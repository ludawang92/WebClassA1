Web Technology and StandardsAssignment 1Luda WangpittID:luw20I am a beginner of HTML and CSS, so I learned a lot from this assignment. (for 5 separate pages three include in the iframe like the demo in ppt).Things I learned:1. <div> tag is useful to build the website frame and assign each div with different CSS class and Id which can override parent <div> if they are same.(Sorry for using tag<div>, I built the frame all by myself. The TA allowed me to do it).2. JavaScript can use variable name to deal with different <iframe> part. 3. Google Chrome Browser is useful when I wrote CSS style.Where I struggled:1. The size of background image.2. The iframe does not work well before I know that I need to assign ID for it.3. SVG path is so weird and I use a online path generator to solve it.A-ha moments:1. The color of row in table can be changed by even and odd number of row.2. Mail to someone link is amazing.Because I am new to HTML and CSS, this assignment took me a long time about 5 or more hours (can¡¯t remember exactly) .Advice: For the new HTML5 use, I am not very sure why those tags should be used, like<header>, <article>. If you can assign 3 tags that is crucial for website, or do something with those tags. It should be better.
